The KDE on FreeBSD project packages CMake, Qt, and software from the KDE Community, for the FreeBSD ports tree.
The software includes a full desktop environment called KDE Plasma (for both X11 and Wayland) and hundreds of applications that can be used on any FreeBSD machine.
The mailto:kde@FreeBSD.org[KDE team] is part of mailto:desktop@FreeBSD.org[desktop@], building the software stack to make FreeBSD beautiful and usable as a daily driver graphical desktop workstation.

We missed last quarterly status report. The changes from the second quarter are included in this report.

==== Infrastructure

CMake was updated to 3.31.9, the latest release in 3.x series.
Ninja was updated to 1.13.1.

Qt6 was updated to 6.9.2.
Both of the Python bindings for the Qt6 toolkit have been updated to their latest releases:

* PyQt6: updated to 6.9.1
* PySide6: updated to 6.9.2

The package:graphics/qt6-wayland[] port was patched to fix crashes of Plasma on Wayland when right-clicking the desktop.

Qt5 was updated to 5.15.17 KDE patch collection.
Upstream standard support for Qt5 is officially over.
This might be the last update for Qt5 on FreeBSD.

The package:www/qt5-webengine[] port has been updated to 5.15.19 with security patches up to Chromium 135.0.7049.95.
The Qt5 WebEngine component, however, is and forever will be based on Chromium 87.0.4280.144, which is over 4 years old.
Security updates for the underlying Chromium base have now ceased. Use at your own risk.

==== KDE Stack

KDE Frameworks, Plasma, and Gear release happen very regularly. mailto:kde@FreeBSD.org[KDE team] lands these updates shortly after their upstream release.

* KDE Frameworks reached version 6.18.0.
* KDE Plasma Desktop was updated to 6.4.5.
* KDE Gear was updated to 25.08.1.

Plasma 6.5 Beta (6.4.90) was ported but not committed to the main ports-tree.

The package:net-mgmt/kf6-networkmanager-qt[] port with stub implementation for Linux NetworkManager was added to aid porting third-party software.

==== Related Ports

The mailto:kde@FreeBSD.org[KDE team] maintains a wide range of ports and updates them all as needed.
According to link:https://portscout.freebsd.org/kde@freebsd.org.html[Portscout] less than 0.7% ports are outdated.
