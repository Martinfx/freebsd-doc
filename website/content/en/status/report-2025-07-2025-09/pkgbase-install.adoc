=== Support for installing pkgbase systems

Contact: Isaac Freund <ifreund@freebsdfoundation.org>

The FreeBSD 15.0 snapshot installation images (disc1.iso, dvd1.iso) now include offline pkgbase packages rather than traditional distribution tarballs.
This makes it possible to install a pkgbase system without an internet connection.

Patches to build FreeBSD 15.0 VM and cloud images as pkgbase systems are in review and should land soon.
Switching the VM and cloud images over to pkgbase is the last major step needed to make pkgbase the default installation path for FreeBSD 15.0.
