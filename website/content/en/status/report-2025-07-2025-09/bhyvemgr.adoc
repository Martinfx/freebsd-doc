Bhyvemgr is a bhyve management GUI written in Freepascal/Lazarus on FreeBSD.
It needs a bunch of tools, mostly installed on base system, and some installed from ports/packages.
The main goal is to be a desktop application with focus on desktop users to easily and quickly setup and run virtual machines on FreeBSD hosts.

During this quarter, there were many bugfixes and improvements to Bhyvemgr.

These are some highlights that were added:

- Add swtpm support to FreeBSD >=1403000.
- Add x86.verbosemsr setting on FreeBSD >=1500023.
- Add IPv6 support.
  It enhances a better IPv6 support using package:dns/dnsmasq[].
  A host-record will be added to dnsmasq when Use_IPv6 is enabled.
- Add a bridge IPv6 calculator at Bhyve Manager Settings.
  It helps us to calculate what IPv6 must be assigned to bridge interface.
  Take a look at README for more information about that.
- Add support to create virtual machines from Cloud or VM images.
  A new page will appear when "Create a virtual disk from image" option is selected.
  It includes an image downloader (only support img.xz, raw.xz, qcow2.xz, qcow2, img, and raw files).
- Add Cloud init/Nuageinit configuration files support.
- Add user-data, network-config, and meta-data templates used from image minimal configuration.
- Add user-data, network-config, and meta-data samples files.
- Add support to define static ipv4 address when files configuration is selected from "Create Virtual Machine/Image" form.
- Add new option to select images path directory from "Settings".
  This directory is used to storage extracted images files.
  By default, it is located at [.filename]#~/.bhyvemgr#.
- Add new option to define qemu-img path file.
- Add i18n support with initial English, Simplified Chinese (thanks to link:https://github.com/ykla[ykla]) and Spanish translations.
- Enhanced logging support.
- Enhanced clipboard support.

Bhyvemgr supports aarch64 from 15-PRERELEASE to 16-CURRENT and amd64 from FreeBSD 13.x to 16-CURRENT.
Also, package:sysutils/bhyvemgr[] can be compiled or installed from link:https://ports.freebsd.org/cgi/ports.cgi?query=bhyvemgr&stype=name&sektion=sysutils[ports] or pkg binaries with gtk2, qt5 or qt6 interface support.

People interested in helping or supporting the project are welcome.
